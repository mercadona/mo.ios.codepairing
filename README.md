# Code Pairing üçé

**Hello candidate! This repository holds the code you will be working on during the pair programming exercise, we encourage you to look around, get familiar with the code and even set up your own dev environment if you prefer so. That way you hopefully are better prepared and it makes the whole exercise more enjoyable, but we ask you to please not make any additions or changes to the code, for each line of code you modify a kitten dies and we don't want that to happen, do we?**
